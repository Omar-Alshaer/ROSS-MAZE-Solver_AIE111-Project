### AIE111 – Artificial Intelligence Engineering  
**Final Project**
---


## 📌 Project Overview

**ROSS MAZE Solver** is an interactive, game-based AI application that visually demonstrates the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm in action.  
The project allows users to design custom mazes, define start and goal positions, and observe how BFS systematically explores the maze to find the **shortest path**.

The application is built using **Python** and **Pygame**, focusing on algorithm visualization, user interaction, and real-time animation.

## 🧩 Algorithm Explanation

### 🔹 What is Breadth-First Search (BFS)?

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.  
It guarantees finding the **shortest path** in unweighted graphs, making it ideal for maze-solving problems.

---

### 🔹 How BFS Works

1. Start position is added to a queue and marked as visited  
2. Repeatedly:
   - Dequeue the current cell
   - Check if it is the goal
   - Explore its 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)
3. Valid, unvisited neighbors are:
   - Marked as visited
   - Assigned a parent cell
   - Added to the queue
4. Once the goal is reached, the shortest path is reconstructed using parent pointers

### 🔹 BFS Pseudocode

```text
BFS(grid, start, goal):
    queue ← start
    visited[start] ← true
    
    while queue not empty:
        current ← dequeue
        if current == goal:
            return path
        
        for each neighbor:
            if valid and not visited:
                visited ← true
                parent ← current
                enqueue neighbor
````

### 🔹 Why BFS is Optimal for Maze Solving

| Property                | Benefit                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Shortest Path Guarantee | Always finds minimum steps     |
| Completeness            | Finds a solution if one exists |
| Systematic Exploration  | Explores level by level        |
| Visual Clarity          | Easy to animate and understand |

### 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(V)`
* Grid size: **15 × 16 = 240 cells**
